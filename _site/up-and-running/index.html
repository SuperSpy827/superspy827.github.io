    <p>This post shows how I created and hosted my blog on Github Pages. While it details my experiences, it can be used as a starting guide for anyone looking to do so. I wrote this to show that it isn’t difficult to get one running.</p>

<p>First I went and bought a domain at <a href="https://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> since strange TLDs (like .tech) have a deal that makes them only $0.88. It took about 30 to 40 minutes for the DNS registars to be updated.</p>

<p>I use Github Pages (GP) - a free service offered by Github that lets me host a personal static website through a repository - to host this website as everything is stored on Gitub’s servers without any help from me. I made a <em>CNAME</em> file in this website’s repository and put just my domain in it like the GP docs say to.</p>

<p>The website itself is a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll</a> one. Their website states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that it can be used to host a blog with greater ease than a traditional static HTML. It is also supported by Github Pages which was the deal breaker for me. You can find out more about Jekyll and how to use it <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme">here</a>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, making and hosting a blog on Github Pages isn’t a dificult thing to do as my post - hopefully - illustrates. Feel free to contact me for help at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#097;&#108;&#107;&#111;&#103;&#097;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#116;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#101;&#097;&#108;&#107;&#111;&#103;&#097;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>
