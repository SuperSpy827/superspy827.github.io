title: Creating & Hosting a Blog on Github Pages
---

This post shows how I created and hosted my blog on Github Pages. While it details my experiences, it can be used as a starting guide for anyone looking to do so. I wrote this to show that it isn't difficult to get one running.

First I went and bought a domain at [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) since strange TLDs (like .tech) have a deal that makes them only $0.88. It took about 30 to 40 minutes for the DNS registars to be updated. 

I use Github Pages (GP) - a free service offered by Github that lets me host a personal static website through a repository - to host this website as everything is stored on Gitub's servers without any help from me. I made a *CNAME* file in this website's repository and put just my domain in it like the GP docs say to.

The website itself is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) one. Their website states that:

>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

This means that it can be used to host a blog with greater ease than a traditional static HTML. It is also supported by Github Pages which was the deal breaker for me. You can find out more about Jekyll and how to use it [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme).

In conclusion, making and hosting a blog on Github Pages isn't a dificult thing to do as my post - hopefully - illustrates. Feel free to contact me for help at [therealkoga@gmail.com](mailto:therealkoga@gmail.com).
